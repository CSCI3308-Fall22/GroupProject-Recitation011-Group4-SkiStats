Project Board Update Notes
    We all need to be updated on merges
    After login, you can see hotels, mountains and wishlist 
    Home page is different from discover page now
    Discover page can direct to ski resort page and hotel page where we mention weather modals, etc

    CART table

    Thinking we need to have less in modal, make it look like more work
    Checkout system?
    finish in steps 1) ski mountain and map 2) hotel 3) save 

    Multipage modal for this idea

    Sit down merge code, finish release notes that are automated.
