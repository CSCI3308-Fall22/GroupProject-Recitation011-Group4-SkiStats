Skitistics or SkiStats
        In a world overrun by traffic and crowded mountains, Skitistics creates and plans a ski trip for you. Users will use this application similar to how AirBNB runs where they will put in an area and days they are able to travel and this website will create a list of fully created ski trips. It will show the user recommended hotel/area of stay, ski resort, and an overall POWDER score of the trip based on its traffic, powder, and conditions. 


Vision Statement
        For the bold adventurers out there looking for the best tracks, Skitistics provides the one stop spot to create the perfect ski trip for any shredder. slay1


Communication Plan
        We have created a groupchat via phone numbers to communicate directly with each other and we also have our github repository open to communicate.


Meeting Plans
