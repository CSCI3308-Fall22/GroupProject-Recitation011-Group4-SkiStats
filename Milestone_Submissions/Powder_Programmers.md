## Skitistics or SkiStats
In a world overrun by traffic and crowded mountains, Skitisticscreates and plans a ski trip for you. Users will use thisapplication similar to how AirBNB runs where they will put in anarea and days they are able to travel and this website willcreate a list of fully created ski trips. It will show the userrecommended hotel/area of stay, ski resort, and an overallPOWDER score of the trip based on its traffic, powder, andconditions.
